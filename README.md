# README: Capstone Project - Brooklyn Born Skin Hand Sanitizer Online Shop

## Overview
This capstone project is focused on building an online shop for my hand sanitizer business, which merges health consciousness with luxurious scent profiles and high-quality ingredients. The website is designed to offer a seamless shopping experience, from learning about the brand to purchasing products.

## Pages and Features

1. **Home Page**:
   - **Logo**: Showcases the brand's identity.
   - **Business Message**: Highlights the unique aspects of the sanitizers, including their benefits compared to competitors.
   - **Image**: Displays a woman using the sanitizer, reinforcing the brand's message.
   - **Navigation Bar**: Located on the right side, allowing easy access to other pages.

2. **Product Page**:
   - **Product Display**: Showcases all seven hand sanitizers scents.
   - **Descriptions**: Details the scent profiles and the inspiration behind each product.
   - **Images**: Visually compliment the sanitizers.

3. **Register Page**:
   - **Sign-Up**: Users can register with their email, create a username, and set a password.
   - **Survey**: Asks how the user heard about the company (Google, Word of Mouth, or Social Media)
   - **QR Code**: Offers a free gift (a video of a mask) for users who register, part of the presentation.

4. **Login Page**:
   - **Returning Customers**: Users can log in to access their accounts.

5. **Checkout Page**:
   - **Billing Information**: Displays the billing address and payment details.
   - **Cart**: Shows selected products and the total cost.

## Standout Feature
One standout feature of my project is the QR code on the registration page, which links to a video showing the mask that customers will receive as a free gift upon signing up.

My capstone project combines the HTML and CSS functions that we've mastered so far and testing these key elements by building my website for health-conscious, luxurious hand sanitizers!
